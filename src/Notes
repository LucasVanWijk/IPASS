BigDecimal requirs String.valueOf because

    The double constructor can be somewhat unpredictable. This has something to do with the binary representation of floating point numbers.
    String constructors are predictable. Therefore use the path of double -> String -> BigDecimal.

    F = (G * M * m *) / r^2

    For stable orbit the folowing is true

    F(c) = F(g)
    F(c) = m*a
    a = v^2 / r
    F(c) = (m * v^2 ) / r

    (m * v^2 ) / r = (G * M * m *) / r^2

    m * v^2 = (G * M * m *) / r

    v^2 = G*M/r

    So for my calculations I will use these formula.
    Notably the direction of the velocity is not important because these formula only count
    when stable orbit is reached.
    This means that the direction of the speed is spherical or elliptical anyway.
    And therfore does not matter in which derection it is
